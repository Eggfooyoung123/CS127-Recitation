## HC3 Summary

  The NYC Clean Heat Program promotes sustainable heating and cooling practices, advocating for the adoption of environmentally friendly alternatives such as cold climate air source heat pumps and ground source heat pumps. By discouraging the use of fossil fuels, the program not only benefits the environment but also improves individual health by reducing the emission of harmful toxins from traditional heaters. The DEP Boiler Registration addresses air pollution concerns by monitoring and regulating soot emissions from older buildings, contributing to cleaner air in the city. Additionally, the Greener Greater Buildings Plan focuses on energy efficiency, targeting buildings responsible for a significant portion of NYC's energy consumption. Mandating benchmarking, audits, and upgrades, the plan values transparency in energy usage and aims to build a workforce capable of delivering greater energy efficiency. For effective transition to clean heating fuels, careful fuel selection, secure financing, and efficient coordination among parties involved are crucial to ensure a smooth and environmentally responsible shift.
